# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously at Kopiso. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to security@kopiso.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. Allow us 48 hours to acknowledge receipt
4. We will provide regular updates on the fix progress
5. We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Scope

This policy applies to:
- The main Kopiso web application
- API endpoints
- Admin dashboard
- Authentication system
- Payment processing
- Data handling

### Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope:
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security
- Denial of service attacks
- Spam or content injection

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Always use strong password policies
- Implement proper session management
- Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement role-based access control
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt with high rounds)

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Never log sensitive information
- Use environment variables for secrets

#### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Validate request payloads
- Implement proper error handling
- Use CSRF protection
- Implement API versioning

#### Code Security
- Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use static code analysis tools
- Implement security headers

### For Administrators

#### Server Security
- Keep the server operating system updated
- Use a firewall to restrict access
- Implement intrusion detection
- Regular security audits
- Backup data regularly
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

#### Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Limit database user privileges
- Encrypt database connections
- Regular database backups
- Monitor database access
- Keep database software updated

#### Application Security
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security scans
- Keep application dependencies updated
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement access controls

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Session management with secure cookies
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Password strength requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission-based resource access
- Admin panel access restrictions
- API endpoint protection
- Resource-level authorization
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Secure data transmission (HTTPS)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload security

### Infrastructure Security
- Security headers implementation
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- CORS policy enforcement
- CSP implementation
- Secure cookie configuration
- SSL/TLS configuration

### Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed authentication monitoring
- Suspicious activity detection
- Error logging and monitoring
- Performance monitoring
- Security audit trails

## Security Headers

We implement the following security headers:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## Data Handling

### Personal Data
- We collect only necessary personal information
- Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest
- Access to personal data is restricted and logged
- Data retention policies are enforced
- Users can request data deletion
- GDPR compliance measures implemented

### Payment Data
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- No storage of sensitive payment information
- Secure payment gateway integration
- Tokenization of payment methods
- Regular security assessments
- Encrypted payment data transmission

### Business Data
- Access controls for business-sensitive data
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Audit trails for data modifications
- Data integrity checks
- Secure data disposal
- Business continuity planning
